# Entropy-Calculator
 Small application assignment for my Theory of Information university course. Takes input from the keyboard and/or .txt files from the file explorer and calculates the Average Information Entropy. Moreover, it outputs the characters that appear in the input text with the amount of times they appear in it, along with the total amount of characters in the text.
